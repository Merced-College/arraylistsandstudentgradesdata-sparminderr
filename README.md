What part of this lab was easiest and why?

The easiest part of this lab was the linear search section. This part was the easiest because we were more familiar with ArrayLists by the end of the lab. This made it less time consuming, and less confusing. Along with that, since everything was already set up with our arrays we just had to make simple calls to get the course the user searched for. The last thing that made this not too difficult was using the Scanner library which is something we've used more often.
